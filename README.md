A prompt should show up on your web browser starting the password generation process. Input a number between 8 and 128 when prompted to choose the length of your password. The process will end if a number between 8 and 128 is not inputed. Then choose at least one of the following items for characters included in the generated password:
* Uppercase Characters
* Lowercase Characters
* Numerals
* Special Characters

If at least one of these items are not chosen, the generation process is terminated. When all criteria is met, a generated password should appear in the "`Your Secure Password`" field.
